   cd pdf-splitter
   ```

2. **Install the Requirements**:

   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

<!-- ## Usage

### Splitting PDFs

To split a PDF file into separate pages, use the `pdf_splitter.py` script. Here is how you can use it:

1. **Place the PDF file you want to split in the `pdfSource` directory.**

2. **Run the following command**:

   ```bash
   python pdf_splitter.py <input_pdf>
   ```

   Replace `<input_pdf>` with the name of your PDF file (e.g., `example.pdf`).

   The script will split the PDF and save each page as a separate file in the `pdfOutput` directory.

### Merging PDFs

To merge multiple PDF files into a single PDF, use the `pdf_merger.py` script. Here is how you can use it:

1. **Place the PDF files you want to merge in the `pdfSource` directory.**

2. **Run the following command**:

   ```bash
   python pdf_merger.py <output_pdf>
   ```

   Replace `<output_pdf>` with the desired name of your merged PDF file (e.g., `merged.pdf`).

   The script will merge all PDF files in the `pdfSource` directory and save the merged file in the `pdfOutput` directory. -->
